# Welcome to the editor!

Hi! I'm your first Markdown file in **StackEdit**. If you want to learn about StackEdit, you can read me. If you want to play with Markdown, you can edit me. Once you have finished with me, you can create new files by opening the **file explorer** on the left corner of the navigation bar.

# Synchronization

Synchronization is one of the biggest features of StackEdit. It enables you to synchronize any file in your workspace with other files stored in your **Google Drive**, your **Dropbox** and your **GitHub** accounts. This allows you to keep writing on other devices, collaborate with people you share the file with, integrate easily into your workflow... The synchronization mechanism takes place every minute in the background, downloading, merging, and uploading file modifications.

There are two types of synchronization and they can complement each other:

* The workspace synchronization will sync all your files, folders and settings automatically. This will allow you to fetch your workspace on any other device.

  > To start syncing your workspace, just sign in with Google in the menu.
* The file synchronization will keep one file of the workspace synced with one or multiple files in **Google Drive**, 

## SmartyPants

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:
| test |test |
|--|--|
| test | test |
|test|test|

|                  | ASCII                           | HTML                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Single backticks | `'Isn't this fun?'`             | 'Isn't this fun?'              |
| Quotes           | `"Isn't this fun?"`             | "Isn't this fun?"              |
| Dashes           | `-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash` | \-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash |

## UML diagrams

You can render UML diagrams using [Mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/). For example, this will produce a sequence diagram:

```mermaid

```

And this will produce a flow chart:
